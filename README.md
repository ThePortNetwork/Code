# The Port Network
### Programs
You do not need to download all of this project's files in order for it to run. For the bare minimum, you need the **server** and the **client**. The client sends messages to the server and the server distributes them, creating a basic chat application, and the whole thing runs on a specific port, which can be any number above 1024, and an IP, which can be a server IP or just localhost. The other programs are designed to be added to your network, and run on the same port, so that your business, company or friend group can have a server that has many functions and all runs on your very own port network. Enjoy!

### Bugfixing
If your server does not work, try using a different port. The one you are using might be full! If you can't get the programs to work, you can contact us at **7542679363**
