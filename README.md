# The Port Network
### Programs
You do not need to download all of this project's files in order for it to run. For the bare minimum, you need the **server**, the **client** and **port.txt**. The client sends messages to the server and the server distributes them, creating a basic chat application, and the whole thing runs on a specific port, which can be any number, and which you type into **port.txt.** The other programs are designed to be added to your network, and run on the same port, so that your business, company or friend group can have a server that has many functions and all runs on your very own port network. Enjoy!

### Bugfixing
If your server does not work, try using a different port. The one you are using might be full! If you can't get the programs to work, you can contact us at **7542679363**
